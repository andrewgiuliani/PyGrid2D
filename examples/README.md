## ðŸ§ª &nbsp; Examples

This folder contains a number of examples to generate grids:
- `0_annulus` 
- `1_supersonic` 
- `2_ringleb` 
- `3_blobs` 
- `4_annulus_acoustics` 
- `5_circles` 
- `6_channel` 
- `7_doublemach`

For all of the above examples, there is a driver script that can be executed by calling `./driver.py`.  The final driver script can be called to generate grids from command line input.
